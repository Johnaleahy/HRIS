# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an HRIS (Human Resources Information System) Management Tools repository. Currently, it appears to be a minimal mock-up project with only a README.md file containing basic project description.

## Repository Structure

The repository is very minimal at this stage:
- `README.md` - Basic project description
- No package.json or other configuration files present
- No source code directories or files yet
- Uses Git for version control

## Development Status

This appears to be a new/empty project that has been initialized but not yet developed. There are no build tools, dependencies, or development commands configured at this time.

## Next Steps for Development

When working on this repository, you may need to:
1. Determine the technology stack and framework to use
2. Initialize package management (npm, yarn, etc. if using Node.js)
3. Set up project structure and directories
4. Configure build and development tools
5. Add linting and testing frameworks

## Notes

- The project is in its initial stages with minimal setup
- No specific development conventions or patterns established yet
- Future instances should expect to help establish the initial project architecture
